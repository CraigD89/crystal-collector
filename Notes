(Pseudo-code is in my flowchart in the References folder)

Issues
- Nest if win/lose statement into click function - ???
- Needs more DRY code in JS
- When user loses, adds random number to losses

To Do
X - Fix crystal click += userScore
- Test win/loss functions
- Make sure the game keeps looping after win/loss
- Possibly change crystal numbers to an array rather than a randomly generated number
- Organize CSS with classes instead of properties for every single thing

Notes
- I have a better understanding of declaring variables or functions within each other
