(Pseudo-code is in my flowchart image inside the References folder)

Issues
- Needs more DRY code in JS
    - Randomly generated number across all crystal buttons in fewer lines of code - rather than separate commands for each individual crystal
        - Apply above to crystals in resetGame function
- When user loses, adds random number to losses (FIXED)
- Reset game on win or loss (FIXED)

To Do
X - Fix crystal click += userScore
X - Test win/loss functions
X - Make sure the game keeps looping after win/loss
- Organize CSS with classes instead of properties for every single thing

Notes
- I have a better understanding of declaring variables or functions within each other when needed
- I spent a lot of time breaking down my JS code to understand the order to make the whole site fully functional and cohesive
- I will apply what I learned throughout this assignment to fix up my hangman game
