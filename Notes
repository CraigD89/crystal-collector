(Pseudo-code is in my flowchart in the References folder)

Issues
- When crystal is clicked, I recieve "NaN" in console log
    - Can't move forward in the game until this is resolved
- Nest if win/lose statement into click function ???
- Needs more DRY code in JS

To Do
- Fix crystal click += userScore
- Test win/loss functions
- Make sure the game keeps looping after win/loss
- Possibly change crystal numbers to an array rather than a randomly generated number
- Organize CSS with classes instead of properties for every single thing

Notes
- I have a better understanding of declaring variables or functions within each other
