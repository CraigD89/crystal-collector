(Pseudo-code is in my flowchart in the References folder)

Issues
- Needs more DRY code in JS
    - Made a side JS file for cleaner code practice
- When user loses, adds random number to losses (FIXED)

To Do
X - Fix crystal click += userScore
X - Test win/loss functions
- Make sure the game keeps looping after win/loss
- Organize CSS with classes instead of properties for every single thing

Notes
- I have a better understanding of declaring variables or functions within each other
